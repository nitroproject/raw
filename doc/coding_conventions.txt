Coding conventions:

* Use two spaces for identation.
* Try to make the source code lines less than 64 chars wide. This
  improves the visibility. But please, do not go out of the way 
  (artificially breaking your code) to enforce this rule.
* Use "" as delimeter for both static and dynamic strings.
* Use 
    alias :new :old 
  instead of 
    alias_method :new, :old
