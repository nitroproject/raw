= Instalation with RubyGems

1. Download and install RubyGems: 

  http://rubygems.rubyforge.org

2. Install the distribution:

  gem install nitro
  
  If you wish to install Og only:

  gem install og

  (make sure you have the latest stable versions of Ruby and RubyGems
  installed)

  When asked about the dependencies to include, only accept
  the dependencies for the RDBMS backends you are planning
  to use.

3. Set environment variable (required to load RubyGems):

  export RUBYOPT=-rubygems

  You can add this in you .bashrc in Unix.

  Alternatively you can run your applications with the -rubygem 
  option:

  ruby -rubygem xxx.rb

4. To verify that everything works ok, run the command

  nitro

= Installation without RubyGems using script.

Installation without RubyGems is *strongly* discouraged.
However, as Nitro is all about freedom and possibilities,
a standard installation script is provided.

1. Switch to an administrator account 

  For example in Unix:

  $ su -

2. Run the installation script.

  $ ruby setup.rb

This installation script also installs some vendor libraries
that you possibly have allready installed. Use with caution.

Dependencies needed: See 'ProjectInfo' file located in the 
current directory

= Manual installation.

Uncompress your distribution (Unix example):

$ cd my_dir
$ tar xvfz nitro-x.x.x.tar.gz

Put the libray dir in the Ruby path (Unix example):

$ export RUBYOPT='-I path/to/nitro/lib'

or, at windows

> set RUBYOPT=Ic:\dev\nitro\lib;c:\dev\og\lib

You also may have to manualy install the following libraries:

* Nano
* Mega
* RedCloth

= Additional libraries

installs most of them, but here is the complete

libraries are optional.
